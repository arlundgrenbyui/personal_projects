This was a school project that I am quite proud of that I made in cooperation with Peter Oien.
Hearing Test is a simple Android application that is designed to screen applicants' hearing
loss to determine if a professional hearing test should be performed. This project was created
for our sponsor who wanted to create an application that could be used in schools to quickly
and easily determine if a student needs a professional test. This would save time and money
for schools.

The app uses firebase for authentication and storing test results. Tests are performed according
to official protocols used by professionals.

To look at the code we wrote in more detail, the path is:
